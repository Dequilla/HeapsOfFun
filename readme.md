# Heaps Of Fun
This is just me attempting to build a simple heap for fun. It is only a practice project in writing CPP and learning.
In this we create a simple heap that reserves a chunk of memory and reserves this memory (malloc) and then distributes it by it self. It is in some way dependent on malloc still.
